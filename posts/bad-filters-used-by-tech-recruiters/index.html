<meta name="description" content="Talent acquisition is key for Organisation success but unfortunately it is currently driven by army of recruiters who has all the wrong filters for eliminating people. Some of them are:

Relevant Background: This is one of the ridiculous of all filters. I have worked with great engineers who don’t have a CS degree and I also worked with CS engineers who don’t know basic coding. I have also seen cases people getting eliminated based on their CGPA, well, you may have just lost the best employee for your organisation.

I was surprised to see some recruiters filtering the some developers who don’t have particular technology on their resume. For ex: there was one good developer who worked a lot on Java, the recruiter eliminated her saying she don’t have J2EE written anywhere in her profile.">

        <p>Talent acquisition is key for Organisation success but unfortunately it is currently driven by army of recruiters who has all the wrong filters for eliminating people. Some of them are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relevant Background: This is one of the ridiculous of all filters. I have worked with great engineers who don’t have a CS degree and I also worked with CS engineers who don’t know basic coding. I have also seen cases people getting eliminated based on their CGPA, well, you may have just lost the best employee for your organisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was surprised to see some recruiters filtering the some developers who don’t have particular technology on their resume. For ex: there was one good developer who worked a lot on Java, the recruiter eliminated her saying she don’t have J2EE written anywhere in her profile.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Consistency: There is some bias towards people who stick to one company for a long time, particularly recruiters from MNCs, what they don’t realise is talent pool of startups work with a volatile ecosystem which makes their engagement even more volatile. You may be encouraging “un-adaptive” behaviour in your Org.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CTC: There is a lot of competition for good talent. If you are hesitant about matching their market CTC, you may end up with substandard resources. I really feel businesses should try to acquire them somehow, this pays off really well in end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premium colleges: This is the latest fad among a lot of recruiters, everyone wants people from premium institutes. It is extremely unfair for the rest of the 98%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience: This is a tricky situation for organisations. If no one wants to give chance to less experienced people, how will they ever become experienced?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe technology hiring should be done by people with technology background. If you are searching for job and see someone ( Organisation/Recruiter/HR/individuals ) eliminating talent on based on above filters, you are better off not being in such Organisation.</p>
